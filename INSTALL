# Cython
python3 run.py -h
usage: run.py [-h] [-b BASE_WORDS] -t TARGET_PASSWORDS [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [--depth-range DEPTH_RANGE] [--autobase] [--in-memory]

Hashcat rule extractor based on example passwords.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BASE_WORDS, --base-words BASE_WORDS
                        Path to the file with base words (required unless --autobase is used).
  -t TARGET_PASSWORDS, --target-passwords TARGET_PASSWORDS
                        Path to the file with target passwords.
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Path to the output file for the rules. Default: extracted_rules.rule
  --depth-range DEPTH_RANGE
                        Range of Levenshtein distances to find rules for, e.g., "1-5". Default: "1-1"
  --autobase            Automatically generate base words from the target list (memory-intensive).
  --in-memory           Use RAM for all processing. Faster for small datasets but memory-intensive.



# Python3
python3 ruxstractor.py -h
usage: ruxstractor.py [-h] -b BASE_WORDS -t TARGET_PASSWORDS [-o OUTPUT_FILE]
                      [--chains]

Hashcat rule extractor based on example passwords.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BASE_WORDS, --base-words BASE_WORDS
                        Path to the file with base words.
  -t TARGET_PASSWORDS, --target-passwords TARGET_PASSWORDS
                        Path to the file with target passwords.
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Path to the output file for the rules. Default:
                        extracted_rules.rule
  --chains              Enable rule chain extraction (slower, but finds more
                        rules).
